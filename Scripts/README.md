# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i 
Add Infura sepolia api key and private key to .env 
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

```
